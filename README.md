# TodoTube: YouTube Todo Integration

## Description

TodoTube is a Firefox extension that replaces YouTube's recommendation sidebar with your Microsoft To-Do list. This innovative tool aims to reduce distractions and promote productivity by substituting potentially time-wasting video suggestions with a list of tasks you need to accomplish.

The concept behind TodoTube addresses a common scenario: A person visits YouTube to watch something specific, but then gets caught up in the recommendations, watching video after video. By hiding these recommendations and replacing them with a to-do list, TodoTube encourages users to be more mindful of their time and inspires them to quit watching YouTube and start doing something productive.


## Features

- Replaces YouTube's recommendation sidebar with your Microsoft To-Do list


## Usage

1. Click on the extension icon in your browser toolbar
2. Log in to your Microsoft account when prompted
3. Navigate to YouTube, and you should see your To-Do list replacing the recommendation sidebar
4. To refresh your To-Do list, click on the extension icon and select "Refresh To-Do List"


## Future Plans

We have exciting plans for the future of this extension, including:

- Firefox Mobile support
- Integration with Todoist as an alternative to Microsoft To-Do
- Additional customization settings
- Enhanced UI/UX
